# Blackjack-Values

This program simulates 100000 games of blackjack, each with the binary choice of hitting or standing being played at random, then stores the data of every game and produces a graph showing the likelyhood of a player winning if they stand on a given hand (value of a hand) as well as the likelyhood of the player going bust if they were to hit. This plot is mostly useless but I thought it was cool to visualize.
